# contactmanagement
This code implements a Contact Management System where users can add, modify, delete, and search for contacts. Contacts are stored in a vector, and the program provides a menu-based interface for user interaction. Contacts are saved to a file and loaded from it. The code ensures input validation for phone numbers and email addresses.
